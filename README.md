- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kaiaiak
- 👀 I’m interested in using ML to explore building performance standards. For instance, what are the characteristics buildings share that have an energy use intensity (EUI) of less than 30?
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, pandas, tiny_python_projects
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data science for buildings
- 📫 Reach me at kstarn@gmail.com
